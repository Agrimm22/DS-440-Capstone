# DS-440-Capstone
- Clone this github to an enviornment (we used vscode)
- Start by making sure you are in the correct working directory (cd loan_predictor)
- install all the dependencies (pip install "package")
- after packages are installed the project may be ready to run, go to the file called appTest3.py and click the run button. If it runs sucessfully you should see a web link displayed in the terminal. If you get an error saying something like "no such file" then check to make sure your in the loan_predictor directory again. If you are in fact in the correct directory and are still getting errors you might have to run some other files. Start by running a file called modelNewData.py (this could take a little while but probably not longer than 10min) after running this file try running the appTest3.py again. If still getting errors then run the other python files (shap_plot.py and split_data.py) and then run the appTest3.py file again. This has always worked for us so if your still getting errors please contact us.
